# Book Search Engine

This application is a fully functional GraphQL API built with Apollo Server using the MERN stack. This app will allow for a Google Books search. 


## Usage/

Given a Google Books Search when the user loads the search engine they are presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup as well as an input field to search for books and a submit button. When the user clicks on the Search for Books menu option they are presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button. When the user is not logged in and enters a search term in the input field and click submit then they are presented with several search results. When they click the Login/Signup menu option then a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. When the toggle is set to signup then the user is presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password. When the toggle is set to Login then the user is presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and a login button. When the user enters a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button then their account is created and they am logged in to the site. When they are logged into the site the menu options change to see saved books and logout. When the user clicks on the Save button on a book then that book's information is saved to their account. The user can then see their saved books and are presented with all of the books they have saved, they can also then remove a book with the remove button.
